"""Tests for app.api.goals_router -- built as its own isolated FastAPI app
(rather than importing app.main.app) since main.py is intentionally not
touched by this agent (a sibling agent's router gets wired in there by the
integration lead). Demo personas bypass auth entirely (see
app.core.auth.resolve_user_id), so no token is needed here.
