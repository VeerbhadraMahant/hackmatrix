"""Minimal in-memory rate limiter.

Scope/limitation (documented, not hidden): this is a single-process, in-memory
sliding-window counter. It resets on restart and does not share state across
multiple backend instances. That's an acceptable tradeoff for this app's
current scale; a production deployment with >1 backend process should swap
this for a shared store (e.g. Redis) keyed the same way. It still meaningfully
protects against the two costliest abuse paths today: hammering the Gemini
API through /chat, and DoS-ing the CSV parser through /upload.
