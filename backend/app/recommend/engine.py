"""Recommendation engine.

Generates a ranked `list[Recommendation]` by actually calling
`app.simulate.engine.simulate()` for each plausible candidate action -- every
recommendation therefore carries a real, simulated `ImpactEstimate`, not a
hand-waved guess. This is the core "show the expected impact of any
recommended action" requirement.

Candidate generation heuristics (deliberately simple / explainable):
  * every debt -> try prepaying it with ~10% of estimated monthly free cash
    flow
  * every subscription-category recurring item -> try cancelling it
    (in the absence of real usage-detection from analytics-agent, we treat
    ALL subscriptions as candidates and let the impact/ranking speak for
    itself; a real "unused" signal from `app.analytics.recurring` would
    narrow this list -- see TODO below)
  * if the forecast's first_gap_date falls within 30 days -> try
    `shift_payment_date` (if a plausible near-collision exists) and
    `reduce_category_spend` as gap-mitigation candidates
