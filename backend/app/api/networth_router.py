"""Net worth over time -- reconstructed live from Account + Transaction
history (no stored historical-balance table exists, so we don't fabricate
one; see `_reconstruct_account_daily_balances` for the exact method).

Not wired into app.main by this module -- the lead integrates
`networth_router.router` into main.py, to avoid touching the same file as
the sibling ledger/budgets agent.

Reconstruction method (documented once here, this is the load-bearing part):

For a single account with CURRENT balance `B` and transaction history, the
balance as-of the end of day `d` is:

    balance(d) = B - sum(txn.amount for txn in this account where txn.date > d)

i.e. walk backward from today, undoing each transaction's effect on the
running balance one day at a time. This is exact (not a synthetic/fabricated
trend) as long as `B` really is the sum of every transaction ever posted to
the account (true for both the seeded personas and any uploaded-CSV user,
since `balance` is never independently edited outside of transaction
ingestion in this codebase).

Accounts that did not exist for the full requested window: we do NOT
extrapolate a balance before the account's own first transaction (there is
no `opened_date` field on AccountRow, and a reconstructed number before the
account had any activity would be fabricated). Chosen, documented rule:
  - If the account has >=1 transaction: for days strictly before its
    earliest transaction date, the account is simply excluded from that
    day's net-worth sum (it didn't exist yet, so it shouldn't inflate or
    deflate a total for a day before it existed).
  - If the account has zero transactions at all, there is no history to
    reconstruct from either way -- its current balance is used flat across
    the entire window (the only defensible value we have for every day).
