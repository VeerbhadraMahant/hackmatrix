"""Small eval set for the copilot (`python -m app.copilot.eval` from backend/).

Runs `app.copilot.engine.answer()` against ~25 natural-language questions
spanning every intent, whether or not a Gemini key is configured (if one is
present, this exercises the real online path; if not, it exercises the
offline router -- either way every question must produce a valid
AnswerContract). Prints a pass/fail table and a summary line.

Pass criteria per question:
  1. The result validates as an AnswerContract (guaranteed by type, but we
     re-validate via round-tripping through JSON to catch any accidental
     malformed nested data).
  2. `narrative` is non-empty.
  3. If the question implies a recommendation is expected, at least one
     Recommendation is present with a non-null `impact`.
